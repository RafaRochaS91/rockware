I'm a Portuguese Software Engineer that has a combined experience of over 10 years working in very different contexts.
From different countries in Europe and in different companies with varying domains and team setups and sizes.

This made me have quite a very big degree of exposure, having learned with many amazing peers and domains over the course of my experience.
I studied Engineering and Management of Information Systems with specialisation on Distributed Systems - mostly in the Web - which has contributed to a very solid foundation on architectural principles along with organizational evaluation of needs.

I've always done what I do with a passion as it's also one of my main hobbies and interesting - tech fascinates me in the way that it can be leveraged to empowered humanity to be better and take back time to let our creativity flow.

# Why blogging in this day and age?

Well, thats a good question ain't it?
Why would someone blog or even build its own web interface in the age of AI where pretty much research and web search is pretty much becoming solely interfaced via LLM clients?

The reason is mostly to write down my thoughts and potentially interact with like minded people. Also, in this age of AI slop, I wanted to just fuel some custom personalised content into the web in hopes that it might make a dent and diverge from, what will possibly become, the norm of AI generated content.

Practicing my writting skills and at the same time attempting to create engagement as a means to exchange ideas and arguments with the hope of improving myself and potentially help improve others.

# What would I blog about?

I have a massively varied interest set but will narrow it down into Tech and my small side project and experiments, career experience and tips and potentially about other things I love like music, gaming and overall society betterment.

I'll try to dedicate time to have a post a month for now to get started and once I develop the habit I will work on features that allow updates of new content to be made visible more clearly. For now stay tuned!
